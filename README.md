  <h1>Python Slot Machine</h1>

<p> I present to you my first Python project! This is the first of many Python projects to come as I dive in head first to learn this highly versatile programming language. The project is a simple text-base slot machine. I added some minor flair and cleaned up the spacing to make it a littler easier on the eyes. As I learn more about Python, I'll do another run at this project to see how far I can push it.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p> This project helped spark my interest and activate the drive to learn Python. I went from print("Hello World!!") to a defining functions, spinnig while loops, and using statements like if and else! Think I'm hooked... ðŸ¤” ðŸ¤£  As always, Thanks for checking out this project and we'll see on the next one! ðŸ˜Ž</p>
